Adler-Mobile-App
================

This is an iphone application made for Chicago Adler Planetarium.  The basic application suggests turn-by-turn
directions and wayfinding assistance from one gallery to another and additional digital content for each gallery.

This project is highly scaleable.  A more ambition undertaking would include GPS location aware features,
pre-loaded tours, the ability to build new tours and connectivity to facebook, twitter, etc. An advanced
example of the type of application the Adler is looking for: http://www.amnh.org/apps/explorer
